# 💳 Secure Tap-and-Pay Portal

An **IoT-based contactless payment system** that leverages **RFID technology**, **ESP32**, and a modern **web backend/frontend** stack for seamless offline and online payments. This project supports **top-up cards**, **credit card integration**, and **SMS alerts** via **Twilio** for an added layer of security and transparency.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Contactless payments using RFID cards
* 🔐 Secure backend logic with Flask (Python)
* 📡 ESP32 integration for RFID scanning
* 🌐 Streamlit frontend for real-time dashboard and top-up
* 📲 Twilio SMS alerts for every transaction
* 📴 Offline payment capability with top-up support
* 💳 Optional credit/debit card integration for online top-ups

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Tap to Pay**

   * User taps an RFID card on the ESP32-RFID module.
   * ESP32 sends the card UID to the Flask server.

2. **Payment Authorization**

   * Flask checks the UID against a database.
   * If sufficient balance exists, payment is approved and balance is deducted.

3. **Notification**

   * An SMS with transaction details is sent via Twilio to the user's registered mobile number.

4. **Frontend Interaction**

   * Users can check balances, top-up cards, and view transaction history via a Streamlit web app.
   * Credit card/UPI integration is supported for recharging top-up cards.

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup

* ESP32
* RC522 RFID module
* Connect using SPI:

  * SDA → GPIO 5
  * SCK → GPIO 18
  * MOSI → GPIO 23
  * MISO → GPIO 19
  * GND & 3.3V

### 2. ESP32 Code

* Written in Arduino C++
* Sends UID via Wi-Fi to Flask backend
* [Link to `esp32/main.ino`](./esp32/main.ino)

### 3. Flask Backend

* Clone this repo:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tap-pay-portal
  cd tap-pay-portal/backend
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py
  ```
* Configure `.env` with:

  * Twilio SID, Token
  * Stripe API keys (optional)

### 4. Streamlit Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
